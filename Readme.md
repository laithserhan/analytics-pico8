Analytics for your PICO-8 game, powered by Segment.

<br>

## Wait, what?

PICO-8 is a tool that you can use to create (and distribute) small, retro-style games. It's like Unity – the game engine – but with more design constraints to encourage you to keep your project scope small. Admittedly, it's kinda nerdy.

Segment is an awesome analytics product that intends to be your **customer data infrastructure**. You can use Segment to track user events, send events out to hundreds of analytics tools automatically, and use those tools to derive insights from your data. Armed with these insights, you can find ways to improve your game's design.

## Awesome, how do I use it?

If you're new to PICO-8, I suggest skimming the [manual](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php?page=manual) for an overview.

Otherwise, it's as easy as copy-and-pasting [`track.lua`](./track.lua)
